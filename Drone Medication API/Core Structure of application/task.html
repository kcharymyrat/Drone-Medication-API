<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
<p>Create a comprehensive drone delivery system managed through a robust REST API. This system will enable customers to conveniently order medications online, and drones will autonomously deliver these medications to the customer's specified GPS location. Additionally, the drones will be tracked and monitored, allowing for real-time monitoring of their movement and ensuring the safe and efficient delivery of medications. <br/>
<br/>
Importantly, our emphasis will solely be on building our models and repositories. This streamlines the project, allowing us to concentrate on the core functionality of facilitating communication between various components of the system through standardized Spring boot CLI. By doing so, we aim to optimize efficiency and flexibility, making it easier to integrate the drone delivery system with other applications or platforms in the future.</p>
<p>To run the tests, the <code class="language-yaml">application.properties</code> file should contain the following line: <code class="language-yaml">spring.datasource.url=jdbc:h2:file:../droneAPI_db</code></p>
<p>Since 2.3.0, Spring Boot hides error messages by default, to pass the tests, you need to add the following line: <code class="language-yaml">server.error.include-message=always</code> to the <code class="language-yaml">application.properties file</code>.</p>
<h5 id="objectives">Objectives</h5>
<p>In this stage, our goal is to establish the fundamental features of the web service. This involves setting up the core structure of the Spring Boot project and generating entity classes to store essential data related to Drone, Medication, and UserAccount. </p>
<p>We'll leverage Spring Data JPA for seamless data management. For each data model (Drone, Medication, and UserAccount), we'll establish a dedicated repository using Spring Data JPA to ensure efficient interaction with your preferred database.</p>
<p>To streamline communication with the database, we'll define Spring Data JPA interfaces. Finally, we'll build a Spring Boot command-line tool to interact with these repositories, verifying the core functionality of our application.</p>
<p><strong>Example 1. </strong></p>
<p>When managing drone-related data, it's essential to include information that aids in identifying the drone model and its current state. For instance, you can implement a "<strong>Drone" </strong>model field using an enumerated (enum) data type with values like <code class="language-yaml">(LIGHTWEIGHT, MIDDLEWEIGHT, CRUISERWEIGHT, and HEAVYWEIGHT)</code>. This categorization helps distinguish between different drone types based on their design and capabilities. For instance, a drone with a maximum weight of less than or equal to <strong>100</strong> should classify as <code class="language-yaml">LIGHTWEIGHT</code>, while a maximum weight above <strong>100</strong> but less than or equal to <strong>200</strong> should classify as <code class="language-yaml">MIDDLEWEIGHT</code>, Similarly, a drone with a maximum weight above <strong>200</strong> but less than or equals <strong>350</strong> should classify as <code class="language-yaml">CRUISERWEIGHT</code> and one with maximum weight above <strong>350</strong> but not exceeding <strong>500</strong> should classify as <code class="language-yaml">HEAVYWEIGHT.</code></p>
<p>Additionally, incorporating a "<strong>State</strong>" field with Enum values such as <code class="language-yaml">(IDLE, DELIVERING, DELIVERED, RETURNING)</code> provides insight into the current operational status of the drone. This categorization assists in tracking and understanding the drone's activities, whether it's actively delivering, has completed a delivery, is in a standby state, or is in the process of returning to its base.</p>
<p>Example drone data.</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">{

"serialNumber": "S001",

"maxWeight": 100,

"currentWeight": 0,

"batteryCapacity": 10000,

"currentState": "IDLE",

"model": "LIGHTWEIGHT",

"currentCoordinate": "4.815600°N 7.049800°E"

}</code></pre>
<p>In designing a medication model ensuring that each medication in your system has an associated weight value is crucial for efficient drone loading. This weight value serves as a key parameter, providing essential information about the mass of each medication. When loading medications onto a drone, understanding their individual weights becomes vital for ensuring a well-balanced and optimized loading process that aligns with the operational capabilities of the drones in use.</p>
<p>Example medication data</p>
<p>The provided medication sample data includes the <strong>weight</strong> of each medication. This information is critical for drone loading, as it ensures we never exceed the drone's <strong>maximum weight capacity</strong>. By considering the weight of each medication, we guarantee safe and efficient drone operations.</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">{

   "code":"XYGIY_02",

    "name":"Paracetamol",

    "weight":"30",

    "imageURL":"https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.CjEDMQk7TEODMKh4MZFfGgD6D6?w=166&amp;h=180&amp;c=7&amp;r=0&amp;o=5&amp;pid=1.7"

}</code></pre>
<p>Example user account data.</p>
<p>Since each user is assigned a unique phone number, this phone number will be used to identify each user and guide the drone in delivering medication to the user. When managing sample user account data, it is recommended to include an "account" field with an enumerated data type. This field acts as a mechanism for categorizing users, and defining their roles. For example, a user's account field could be set to "ADMIN," "CUSTOMER," or "GUEST" which will determine their access level to certain functions within the system.</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">{

"account": "ADMIN",

"name": "Emily Davis",

"phone": "4157890123",

"address":

"789 Cedar Street, Sacramento, California(CA), 95814",

"coordinates": "38.58157°N, -121.49440°E"
